# TBext Presentation Website 

TBext is a scriptable widget that displays live transport data from Bucharest's public transport network. It allows users to see real-time updates of transport lines and their statuses, making it an essential tool for anyone navigating the city. The widget can even be placed on the lock screen for quick access! - This is only the presentation wesbsite of it!
